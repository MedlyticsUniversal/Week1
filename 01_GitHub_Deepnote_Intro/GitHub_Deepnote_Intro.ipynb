These groups will usually consist of 3 or 4 members. Deepnote has a fully synchronous feature, so multiple collaborators can work on the same notebook at once. One person in your group must share their notebook with the others so that the whole group can edit and work on the same code. To share the notebook with others, follow the steps below.\n\n> 1. Click the **blue \"`Share`\" button** at the top right of your screen in Deepnote. Set the desired access level to **\"Edit\"** from the drop-down field.\n\n![deepnoteshare.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedlyticsUniversal/Data/main/Images/deepnoteshare.png)\n\n> 2. Copy the project link to your clipboard (hit button next to **\"Anyone with a link to this project\"**).\n\n> 3. Send the link to your group members so that they can join you in editing the notebooks for that day (via Discord or Zoom chat).\n\n> 4. Use the **notebook submission form** to log information about your group as well as the notebook link you are working at (right click on the notebook from your file explorer and select \"`Copy link to notebook`\").

Then you can fetch any upstream changes if necessary.\n\nFirst, find the **TERMINALS** menu on the left of the Deepnote environment.\n\n![terminals.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedlyticsUniversal/Data/main/Images/terminals.png)\n\nNow click on the `+` sign to open a new terminal (also known as the command line). Once the terminal is open, you'll need to change into the directory of your repository. Run the list command.\n\n```\nls\n```\n\nNow you should see the contents of the root directory. From here, run the below command to change directory (**write in the name of YOUR repository** after `cd`).\n\n```\ncd Week1\n```\n\nIf it is Week 2 or Week 3, you'll need to substitute in the appropriate number to switch to the correct directory in the terminal.\n\nOnce you are in the directory of your personal forked repository, run the following commands in sequence:\n\n```\ngit add .\ngit commit\n```\nDon't forget the period—it indicates the addition of the current directory and all files within it, recursively.\n\nNow you should see a window where your changes to the files in your directory are listed out. Type a **commit message** (e.g. \"Week 1 Group 1 work\"), which is essentially what you are naming the set of changes you are committing. Now press `ESC`, then type `:wq`, then hit enter. You should have returned to the main window of the terminal.\n\nLastly, run the below command to push your changes to your personal forked repository on GitHub.\n\n```\ngit push\n```\n\nYour screen should look similar to this:\n> In this case, the repository name was `Week_1` and the commit message was \"`Pandas update`\". Do you see it?\n![finishedterminal.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedlyticsUniversal/Data/main/Images/finishedterminal.png)\n\nYou can check to make sure your Git push worked by going to your forked GitHub repository and making sure your changes (and the commit message) show up there. If the push failed or something went wrong in the terminal, don't worry! Deepnote saves your changes automatically, so you won't lose your work. Just ask an instructor for help with pushing those changes to GitHub.\n\nYour *personal* GitHub repository should look similar to this:\n![finishedGitHub.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedlyticsUniversal/Data/main/Images/finishedGitHub.png)","block_group":"00014-a873bab6-865b-4d92-a1fc-320067e5f4ea"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=67231ff1-13ba-4f0b-99c2-0fe76b4d3844' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Colab_Github_Intro.ipynb","provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":[]},"deepnote":{},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","language":"python","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.3","mimetype":"text/x-python","file_extension":".py","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"nbconvert_exporter":"python"},"deepnote_notebook_id":"96c4636d8cc943d7a93bb4e909258602","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
